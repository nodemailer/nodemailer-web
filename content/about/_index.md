# Nodemailer

**Nodemailer** is a module for Node.js applications that allows easy email sending. The project started in 2010 when there were few reliable options for sending email messages, and today, it is the default solution for most Node.js users.

```
npm install nodemailer
```

Check out [EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=nodemailer&utm_campaign=nodemailer&utm_medium=tip-link) â€“ a self-hosted email gateway that allows you to make REST requests to IMAP and SMTP servers. EmailEngine also sends webhooks whenever something changes on the registered accounts.\
\
Using the email accounts registered with EmailEngine, you can receive and [send emails](https://emailengine.app/sending-emails?utm_source=nodemailer&utm_campaign=nodemailer&utm_medium=header-link). It supports OAuth2, delayed sends, opens and clicks tracking, bounce detection, and more, all without needing an external MTA service.

### Nodemailer features

- A single module with **zero dependencies** â€“ easy to audit the code with no hidden complexities
- Emphasis on **security** â€“ avoid [RCE vulnerabilities](http://thehackernews.com/2017/01/phpmailer-swiftmailer-zendmail.html)
- **Unicode support** to use any characters, including emoji ðŸ’ª

- Send **HTML content** with **plain text** alternatives
- Attach **[Attachments](/message/attachments/)** to emails
- Embed **[Images](/message/embedded-images/)** in HTML emails so your design doesn't get blocked
- Secure email delivery with **TLS/STARTTLS**
- Various **[transport methods](/transports/)** beyond the default **[SMTP support](/smtp/)**
- Sign emails with **[DKIM](/dkim/)**
- Custom **[Plugin support](/plugins/)** for advanced message manipulation
- Supports **[OAuth2](/smtp/oauth2/)** authentication
- **[Proxies](/smtp/proxies/)** for SMTP connections
- **ES6 codebase** â€“ fewer chances of memory leaks from hoisted _var_'s
- Autogenerated test email accounts from [Ethereal.email](https://ethereal.email)

#### Requirements

- **Node.js v6.0.0** or newer. That's all you need.

If you're running Node.js version 6 or later, you can use Nodemailer. There are no specific platform or resource requirements. All Nodemailer methods support both callbacks and Promises (if no callback is provided). If you want to use _async..await_, youâ€™ll need Node.js v8.0.0 or newer.

#### TL;DR

To send an email, follow these steps:

1. Create a Nodemailer transporter using either [SMTP](/smtp/) or [another transport method](/transports/)
2. Set up your [message options](/message/) (who sends what to whom)
3. Deliver the message using the **sendMail()** method of your transporter

#### Example

Below is an example to send an email with both plain text and HTML content using [Ethereal Email](https://ethereal.email/).

```javascript
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.ethereal.email",
  port: 587,
  secure: false, // true for port 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: "maddison53@ethereal.email",
    pass: "jn7jnAPss4f63QBp6D",
  },
});

// async..await is not allowed in global scope, must use a wrapper
async function main() {
  // send mail with defined transport object
  const info = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: '"Maddison Foo Koch ðŸ‘»" <maddison53@ethereal.email>', // sender address
    to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com", // list of receivers
    subject: "Hello âœ”", // Subject line
    text: "Hello world?", // plain text body
    html: "<b>Hello world?</b>", // html body
  });

  console.log("Message sent: %s", info.messageId);
  // Message sent: <d786aa62-4e0a-070a-47ed-0b0666549519@ethereal.email>
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
