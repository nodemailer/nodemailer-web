Nodemailer v4+ is licensed under the **MIT license**.

Version 3 of Nodemailer was licensed under the **European Union Public License 1.1 (EUPL)**, which is a _copyleft_ license. For more details on the decision to use EUPL for Nodemailer v3, you can refer to the [Nodemailer blog](https://blog.nodemailer.com/2017/02/02/nodemailer-v3-0-0/). However, after a two-month experiment, I decided to revert Nodemailer back to the MIT license and canceled all active subscriptions.

Using a restrictive license for a lower-level infrastructure module like Nodemailer proved to be more problematic than beneficial. Even I had to use older versions of Nodemailer to avoid licensing issues for client work. Additionally, there wasnâ€™t a significant interest in paid subscriptions or services, and most users continued using the copyleft-licensed Nodemailer in their commercial projects, with little concern for the licensing terms. Without a feasible way to enforce the copyleft license, the decision was made to return to the more permissive MIT license.
