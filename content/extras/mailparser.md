Advanced email parser for Node.js. Everything is handled as a stream which should make it able to parse even very large messages (100MB+) with relatively low overhead.

The module exposes two separate modes, a lower level **MailParser** class and **simpleParser** function. The latter is simpler to use (hence the name) but is less resource efficient as it buffers attachment contents in memory.

## Install

```bash
npm install mailparser --save
```

## simpleParser

**simpleParser** is the easiest way to parse emails. You only need to provide a message source to get a parsed email structure in return. As an additional bonus all embedded images in HTML (eg. the images that point to attachments using cid: URIs) are replaced with base64 encoded data URIs by default, so the message can be displayed without any additional processing. Be aware though that this module does not do any security cleansing (eg. removing javascript and so on), this is left to your own application.

```javascript
const simpleParser = require("mailparser").simpleParser;
simpleParser(source, options, (err, parsed) => {});
```

or as a Promise:

```javascript
simpleParser(source, options)
  .then(parsed => {})
  .catch(err => {});
```

or even with async..await:

```javascript
let parsed = await simpleParser(source, options);
```

Where

- **source** is either a stream, a Buffer or a string that needs to be parsed
- **options** is an optional object which defaults to ```{ keepCidLinks: false }```. If set to ```{ keepCidLinks: true }```, the HTML content will retain the raw cid: URIs for embedded images.
- **err** is the possible error object
- **mail** is a structured email object

### mail object

Parsed **mail\*** object has the following properties

- **headers** â€“ a Map object with lowercase header keys
- **subject** is the subject line (also available from the header _mail.headers.get('subject')_)
- **from** is an address object for the From: header
- **to** is an address object for the To: header
- **cc** is an address object for the Cc: header
- **bcc** is an address object for the Bcc: header (usually not present)
- **date** is a Date object for the Date: header
- **messageId** is the Message-ID value string
- **inReplyTo** is the In-Reply-To value string
- **reply-to** is an address object for the Cc: header
- **references** is an array of referenced Message-ID values
- **html** is the HTML body of the message. If the message included embedded images as cid: urls then these are all replaced with base64 formatted data: URIs
- **text** is the plaintext body of the message
- **textAsHtml** is the plaintext body of the message formatted as HTML
- **attachments** is an array of attachments

### address object

Address objects have the following structure:

- **value** an array with address details

  - **name** is the name part of the email/group
  - **address** is the email address
  - **group** is an array of grouped addresses

- **text** is a formatted address string for plaintext context

- **html** is a formatted address string for HTML context

**Example**

```javascript
{
    value: [
        {
            address: 'andris+123@kreata.ee',
            name: 'Andris Reinman'
        },
        {
            address: 'andris.reinman@gmail.com',
            name: ''
        }
    ],
    html: '<span class="mp_address_name">Andris Reinman</span> <<a href="mailto:andris+123@kreata.ee" class="mp_address_email">andris+123@kreata.ee</a>>, <a href="mailto:andris.reinman@gmail.com" class="mp_address_email">andris.reinman@gmail.com</a>',
    text: 'Andris Reinman <andris+123@kreata.ee>, andris.reinman@gmail.com'
}
```

### headers Map

**headers** is a Map with lowercase header keys. So if you want to check for the Subject: header then you can do it like this:

```javascript
if (mail.headers.has("subject")) {
  console.log(mail.headers.get("subject"));
}
```

The format of a header depends on the specific key. For most header keys the value is either a string (a single header) or an array of strings (multiple headers with the same key were found).

Special header keys are the following:

1.  All address headers are converted into address objects

- **from**
- **to**
- **cc**
- **bcc**
- **sender**
- **reply-to**
- **delivered-to**
- **return-path**

2.  All different priority headers are converted into **priority** with the following values:

- **'high'**
- **'normal'**
- **'low'**

3.  **references** is a string if only a single reference-id exists or an array if multiple ids exist

4.  **date** value is a Date object
5.  The following headers are parsed into structured objects, where _value_ property includes the main value as string and _params_ property holds an object of additional arguments as key-value pairs

- **content-type**
- **content-disposition**
- **dkim-signature**

Some headers are also automaticaly mime-word decoded

- all address headers (name parts and punycode encoded domains are converted to unicode)
- **subject** is converted to unicode

### attachment object

Attachment objects have the following structure:

- **filename** (if available) file name of the attachment
- **contentType** MIME type of the message
- **contentDisposition** content disposition type for the attachment, most probably "attachment"
- **checksum** a MD5 hash of the message content
- **size** message size in bytes
- **headers** a Map value that holds MIME headers for the attachment node
- **content** a Buffer that contains the attachment contents
- **contentId** the header value from 'Content-ID' (if present)
- **cid** contentId without < and >
- **related** if true then this attachment should not be offered for download (at least not in the main attachments list)

## MailParser

**MailParser** is a lower-level email parsing class. It is a transform stream that takes email source as bytestream for the input and emits data objects for attachments and text contents.

```javascript
const MailParser = require("mailparser").MailParser;
let parser = new MailParser();
```

### Event 'headers'

The parser emits 'headers' once message headers have been processed. The headers object is a Map. Different header keys have different kind of values, for example address headers have the address object/array as the value while subject value is string.

Header keys in the Map are lowercase.

```javascript
parser.on("headers", headers => {
  console.log(headers.get("subject"));
});
```

### Event 'data'

Event 'data' or 'readable' emits message content objects. The type of the object can be determine by the _type_ property. Currently there are two kind of data objects

- 'attachment' indicates that this object is an attachment
- 'text' indicates that this object includes the html and text parts of the message. This object is emitted once and it includes both values

### attachment object

Attachment object is the same as in _simpleParser_ except that _content_ is not a buffer but a stream. Additionally there's a method **release()** that must be called once you have processed the attachment. The property _related_ is set after message processing is ended, so at the _data_ event this value is not yet available.

```javascript
parser.on("data", data => {
  if (data.type === "attachment") {
    console.log(data.filename);
    data.content.pipe(process.stdout);
    data.content.on("end", () => data.release());
  }
});
```

If you do not call **release()** then the message processing is paused.

### text object

Text object has the following keys:

- **text** includes the plaintext version of the message. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/plain' node
- **html** includes the HTML version of the message. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/html' node
- **textAsHtml** includes the plaintext version of the message in HTML format. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/plain' node.

```javascript
parser.on("data", data => {
  if (data.type === "text") {
    console.log(data.html);
  }
});
```

## Issues

Charset decoding is handled using [iconv-lite](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite) that is missing some charsets, especially some Japanese ones. If required then it would be possible to switch to native iconv bindings with [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) to handle these missing charsets but for now this option is not used for easier packaging.
